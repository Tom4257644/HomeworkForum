<h1>Homework Forum</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This was the first website I built. It is a basic and not very exciting forum, but it is still a great example of CRUD with databases, database organisation, and a full login and admin system. The main features include asking, answering, and filtering questions in a specific classroom that everyone can see. Also, adding, editing, and deleting users, categories, questions, and answers. This was a school project, so the entire project required demonstrating project management skills, including designing the database with DBdesigner, designing the layout with AdobeXD, and managing my workload with Trello; a full project management writeup document has been included with the code, although I don't recommend reading it, it is long and boring.
The website is actually live at https://stacdigi.nz/tommaclean/index.php?page=recentquestions, username: admin, password: password
